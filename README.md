## 📝 Description

A full CRUD app built with React. 

I built this to see how Redux, TypeScript and Firebase work together. Really well, to be honest. RTK and react-redux packages offer typings straight out of the box and because of Firebase's onSnapshot listener and React's useEffect, there's no need to use createAsyncThunk ar all.
